        <h2>The Collaboration</h2>
        <p>We begin with the rugged GA-110 and bring the popular and charismatic League of Legends champion, Jinx, straight into the action. Boldly printed in vivid color, the bezel and band evoke the wild maverick and her signature weapon, the Super Megadeath rocket. This playful motif is echoed in the small hand shaped like Jinxâ€™s rocket on the inset dial at the 9 o-clock position. This collaboration model is packed with League of Legends energy, including the game logo on the case back and band loop and special packaging designed with League fans in mind.</p>
